📈Live Indian Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning (Google Colab)
This project aims to predict the next-day closing price of Indian stock market companies using machine learning techniques in Google Colab. It utilizes real-time data from Yahoo Finance (via yfinance) for stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India.

🔍 Features
Live stock data fetching using yfinance

Simple Linear Regression model for price prediction

Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices

Compatible with any Indian stock (e.g., RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS, INFY.NS)

Ready-to-run on Google Colab

Easily extendable to advanced models (LSTM, ARIMA, etc.)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Google Colab

yfinance

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

📊 Example
Predicting the closing price of RELIANCE.NS:

python
Copy code
stock = yf.Ticker("RELIANCE.NS")
df = stock.history(period="1y")
🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab

Enter your desired stock symbol

Run all cells to fetch data, train the model, and see predictions

✅ Future Improvements
Integrate LSTM or GRU for better time-series forecasting

Add Streamlit-based web dashboard
